When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When there are other people working on the same project then this remote repository 
  would be quite beneficial. Also, suddenly if my pc crashes and all the data gets lost
  then i can always pull my last commit and start working again.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    This is really important aspect of git pull because i always do not want to commits 
    from remote to my local repository.I only want the commits that are relevant to me.
