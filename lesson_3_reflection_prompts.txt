When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When there are other people working on the same project then this remote repository 
  would be quite beneficial. Also, suddenly if my pc crashes and all the data gets lost
  then i can always pull my last commit and start working again.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    This is really important aspect of git pull because i always do not want to pull commits 
    from remote to my local repository.I only want to pull the commits that are relevant to me
    and that can be be manually only.
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
    Fork- this will be used when i want work on someone else's repository, modify it and 
    want that other people can see it.
    clone- when i to copy the entire repository from github or local space to local directory
    branches- These will be used when i want do some experiment on my code and later on might
    want to merge with original code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    With that, i can work offline on remote copy of code which might be different from the local 
    one and also if it suits me then i can merge it with my local code.
    
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be 
harder?
    As i am new to version control system, i don't think that there is any other good alternative.
    Things would be harder only.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?
    I'll go for the first approach i.e. to make changes to separate branch when I am working with
    other people and need to get my change approved from them. With this, I can make sure that my
    master branch local/remotre remain unaffected by the change i proposed to introduce till it is
    not merged by other collaboraters.
